1. Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing chess?". If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing chess!

2. Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string. We will consider 
```a, e, i, o, u``` as vowels. The input string consist of both lower and upper case letters and/or spaces.

3. Make a program that will return a `min` and `max` value of a list. For eg `[4,6,2,7,9]` should return `max = 9` and `min = 2`

4. Make a program that will filter duplicate item in a list for eg  `[1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6]` will be  `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
5. Square each elements in this list `[9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]` and then sum the new list!
